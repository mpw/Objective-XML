# Objective-XML


This project has been merged into MPWFoundation so is obsolete as a stand-alone project.



Flexible, powerful and *fast* XML tools for Objective-C.   Provides a single API that can be NSXMLParser-compatible (just a lot faster)
DOM-compatible (similar to NSXMLDocument) or generate custom objects directly, with the ability to mix-and-match as needed.
